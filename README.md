# ATM-Machine
This is my ATM machine project in Java that incorporates a variety of OOP concepts. 
The ATM is displayed in the IDE terminal and asks for a user's account number and pin.
Each account number and pin is stored within a hashmap, where the key is the account number 
and the value is the corresponding pin number. 
Once the account number and pin number are validated in the terminal, the user can deposit, 
withdraw, or view their account balance.
